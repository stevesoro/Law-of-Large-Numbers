This is a simulation demonstrating the law of large numbers.
According to this law, the average of the results from a large quantity of independent random samples approaches (or converges to) the true expected value as the number of samples increases.
In other words, as the number of samples grows, the sample average becomes a more accurate estimate of the population's true average.
